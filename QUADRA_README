This file patches armbian mainline (current) to build Quadra firmware (also T95 mini/max boards based on H6 SoC).

To use,

1.  Install armbian: "git clone https://github.com/armbian/build
2.  Type "cd build"
3.  Copy this "quadra-patches.zip" file here
4.  Type "sudo unzip quadra-patches".  Confirm overwrites
5.  Build armbian as usual:  "sudo ./compile.sh"

Select board aw-h6-tv in the CSC section.  Select "current".  Edge is WIP (xr819 wifi not working on kernels 5.19+).  XFCE Desktop is known to work.

Shortcuts:

1.  Server builds:  

sudo ./compile.sh  BOARD=aw-h6-tv BRANCH=current RELEASE=bullseye BUILD_MINIMAL=no BUILD_DESKTOP=no KERNEL_ONLY=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha,gpg,img

2.  Desktop builds:

sudo ./compile.sh  BOARD=aw-h6-tv BRANCH=current RELEASE=bullseye BUILD_MINIMAL=no BUILD_DESKTOP=yes KERNEL_ONLY=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENT=xfce DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG_NAME=config_base DESKTOP_APPGROUPS_SELECTED="browsers" COMPRESS_OUTPUTIMAGE=sha,gpg,img 

3.  If you changed patch files and want to force recompiling of the kernel, add:

	USE_CCACHE=no

Note:

Armbian won't update itself as we changed 2 build files.  So if you want to update Armbian, easiest way is to re-install Armbian, re-apply this patch and rebuild.
